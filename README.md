## Buisness Objective </b> 
- Using Logistic Regression can we determine whether a customer will Churn?
## Project Overview
The dataset is publically available on the Kaggle website,  The raw dataset can be found on the Kaggle website, 
[here]([https://www.kaggle.com/amanajmera1/framingham-heart-study-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/renatevankempen/predicting-clv/notebook)). 
- <b>Research</b> 
  -Customer Lifetime Value Prediction( CLV ) value refers to net profit attributed to the entire future relationship with a customer. A bank will use different predictive analytic approaches to predict the revenue that can be generated from any customer in the future. This helps the banks in segmentating the customers in specific groups based on their CLV.
